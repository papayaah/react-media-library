# Product Overview

@buzzer/media-library is a lightweight, high-performance headless media library for React 19. It provides complete media management functionality while remaining UI-agnostic through a preset system.

## Core Features

- Drag & drop file upload with zero-layout-shift experience

- Multiple view modes (grid, list, masonry)
- Select mode with bulk operations
- Image/video viewer with editing capabilities
- Persistent storage using IndexedDB and OPFS
- Optional icon system (supports any icon library)

## Key Design Principles

- **Headless/UI-agnostic**: Works with any UI library through component presets
- **Performance-first**: Optimized for speed with skeleton loaders, lazy loading, and smooth transitions
- **Zero layout shift**: Upload experience maintains stable layout throughout file processing
- **Flexible**: Optional dependencies (icons, image cropping) and customizable presets
